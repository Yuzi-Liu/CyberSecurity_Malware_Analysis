# CyberSecurity_Malware_Analysis
The project's objecticve is to evaluate different classification models to predict malicious and benign websites, based on application layer and network characteristics.

In this project, we attempt to answer the following questions:
1. How to detect a malicious website?
2. What are the characteristics of malicious websites?

Our team performed a substantive analytical research to solve this classification problem and build a model upon it to predict malicious and benign websites.
